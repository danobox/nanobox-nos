#### Payload

##### payload(1)

    $1 = key

    A simple getter for fetching a payload value

#### Validation

##### validate_presence(1)

    $1 = field
    
    Validate that a field exists within the boxfile payload and has a value.
    If the check fails, a fatal error will be printed an a non-zero exit
    will be forced.

##### validate_in(2)

    $1 = field
    $2 = possible values
    
    Validates that if a field exists, the value present falls within a range
    of acceptable options.
    
##### validate_not_in(2)

    $1 = field
    $2 = possible values
    
    Validates that if a field exists, the value present falls does not fall
    within a range of options.
